# Higher-Lower-Game
This Python program implements a game where the user has to guess which of two social media accounts has more followers. The game continues until the user guesses incorrectly.

Features:
- Randomly selects two social media accounts from a predefined dataset
- Displays account information (name, description, country)
- Asks the user to guess which account has more followers
- Checks the user's answer and updates the score
- Continues the game until the user guesses incorrectly

How it works:
1. The program prints a game logo and initializes the score to 0.
2. It randomly selects two social media accounts from the dataset.
3. It displays the information of both accounts and asks the user to guess which one has more followers.
4. The user inputs their guess (1 or 2).
5. The program checks the user's answer by comparing the follower counts of both accounts.
6. If the user's answer is correct, their score is incremented.
7. The game continues until the user guesses incorrectly, at which point their final score is displayed.
This code demonstrates basic Python concepts such as random selection, conditional statements, loops, and functions. It also uses external modules for game logo and data.
